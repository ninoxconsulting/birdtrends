# Getting_started

The birdtrends package enables users to estimate trends of populations
into the future based on a variety of input data types.

## Getting set-up

1.  Install birdtrends

``` r
remotes::install_github("ninoxconsulting/birdtrends")
```

2.  Set up modelling connections.

The birdtrends package uses the cmdstanr package to run the hierarchical
GAM models using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). We can install cmdstanr
with:

``` r
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/",
                                       getOption("repos")))
```

The cmdstanr package in turn requires the `cmdstan` program to run Stan
programs. You can use the `cmdstanr` package to `cmdstan`:

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

And then check that `cmdstan` was installed properly:

``` r
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()
```
